# Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company using machine learning techniques. By analyzing customer data, the model helps identify which customers are likely to leave the company, enabling targeted retention strategies.

## Features

- **Data Exploration:** Comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand customer behavior.
- **Feature Engineering:** Techniques for transforming raw data into meaningful features.
- **Model Training:** Implementation of various machine learning models to predict churn.
- **Model Evaluation:** Metrics and visualizations to assess model performance.
- **Deployment:** AWS SageMaker Deployment.

## Data

The dataset used in this project includes customer information such as demographics, service usage, and account details. The data is provided in CSV format and is pre-processed for analysis.

## Getting Started

## If you want run localy:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/karen0vich/Customer-Churn-prediction.git 
    cd pytorch-snake-ai-game 
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run JupyterLab:

    ```bash 
    cd notebooks 
    jupyter lab
    ```
